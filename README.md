This repository contains a Julia function with a subtle bug related to its handling of zero. The function is designed to square positive inputs and negate negative inputs; however, its behavior is undefined for zero. This issue can lead to unexpected results in applications that rely on this function. The solution provided addresses this by explicitly handling the zero case.
